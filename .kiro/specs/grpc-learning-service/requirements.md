# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create a simple gRPC service using Quarkus that serves as a learning platform for gRPC concepts. The service will demonstrate core gRPC patterns including unary calls, server streaming, client streaming, and bidirectional streaming. Additionally, it will expose REST reactive endpoints to showcase how gRPC services can be integrated with traditional REST APIs, providing a comprehensive learning experience for both gRPC and reactive programming concepts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer learning gRPC, I want a simple user management service with basic CRUD operations, so that I can understand how gRPC handles different types of service calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a CreateUser request THEN the system SHALL create a new user and return the created user details
2. WHEN a client sends a GetUser request with a valid user ID THEN the system SHALL return the user details
3. WHEN a client sends a GetUser request with an invalid user ID THEN the system SHALL return a NOT_FOUND error
4. WHEN a client sends an UpdateUser request THEN the system SHALL update the user and return the updated details
5. WHEN a client sends a DeleteUser request THEN the system SHALL remove the user and return a success confirmation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer learning gRPC streaming, I want to see server streaming in action, so that I can understand how to handle continuous data flows from server to client.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client requests to list all users THEN the system SHALL stream each user individually to the client
2. WHEN there are no users THEN the system SHALL complete the stream without sending any user data
3. WHEN an error occurs during streaming THEN the system SHALL terminate the stream with an appropriate error status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer learning gRPC streaming, I want to implement client streaming, so that I can understand how to handle continuous data flows from client to server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client streams multiple user creation requests THEN the system SHALL process each request and return a summary of created users
2. WHEN the client completes the stream THEN the system SHALL return the total count of successfully created users
3. WHEN invalid user data is streamed THEN the system SHALL continue processing valid requests and report errors in the final response

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer learning gRPC streaming, I want to implement bidirectional streaming, so that I can understand real-time communication patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client establishes a bidirectional stream for user notifications THEN the system SHALL acknowledge the connection
2. WHEN a client sends a subscription request for user updates THEN the system SHALL stream relevant user change notifications
3. WHEN a user is created, updated, or deleted THEN the system SHALL notify all subscribed clients
4. WHEN a client disconnects THEN the system SHALL clean up the subscription

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer learning REST integration, I want REST reactive endpoints that interact with the gRPC service, so that I can understand how to bridge gRPC and REST architectures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a REST client sends a GET request to /api/users/{id} THEN the system SHALL call the gRPC GetUser service and return JSON response
2. WHEN a REST client sends a POST request to /api/users THEN the system SHALL call the gRPC CreateUser service and return JSON response
3. WHEN a REST client sends a PUT request to /api/users/{id} THEN the system SHALL call the gRPC UpdateUser service and return JSON response
4. WHEN a REST client sends a DELETE request to /api/users/{id} THEN the system SHALL call the gRPC DeleteUser service and return appropriate status
5. WHEN a REST client sends a GET request to /api/users THEN the system SHALL call the gRPC streaming service and return a JSON array

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer learning error handling, I want proper error handling and validation in both gRPC and REST layers, so that I can understand best practices for error management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid input is provided THEN the system SHALL return appropriate gRPC status codes (INVALID_ARGUMENT, NOT_FOUND, etc.)
2. WHEN REST endpoints encounter gRPC errors THEN the system SHALL translate them to appropriate HTTP status codes
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating what went wrong
4. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors appropriately and return generic error messages to clients

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer learning gRPC tooling, I want proper logging and monitoring capabilities, so that I can understand how to observe gRPC services in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN gRPC calls are made THEN the system SHALL log request/response details with appropriate log levels
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error details with stack traces for debugging
3. WHEN streaming operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log stream lifecycle events
4. WHEN REST endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL log the interaction with the underlying gRPC service
